I have been entrolled in the Advanced Statistics course at https://www.uclaextension.edu/sciences-math/math-statistics/course/advanced-statistics-and-quantitative-methods-stats-x-4021?method=load&courseId=155546. To make it more applied, I tried to implement theoretical concepts in practice by coding them in Python. Almost all the functions are written in a pythonic way, rather than going for ready libraries - to be explored as a next step.
